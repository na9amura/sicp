; what is the order of growth?
; 1. spaces 
;   Requires O(1) as this procedure is tail recursive.

; 2. steps
;   This procedure repeats (a * (1/3  ^ k)) times for 'k' fills this condition
;   a / (3 ^ k) <= 0.1 < a / (3 ^ (k - 1))

;   log(3) (a / (3 ^ k))      <= log(3) 0.1 < log(3) (a / (3 ^ (k - 1)))
;   log(3) a - log(3) (3 ^ k) <= log(3) 0.1 < log(3) a - log(3) (3 ^ (k - 1))
;   log(3) a - k * log(3) 3   <= log(3) 0.1 < log(3) a - (k - 1) * log(3) 3
;   log(3) a - k              <= log(3) 0.1 < log(3) a - k + 1

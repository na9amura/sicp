### recursive process

- if a process grows linearly with n, it called a linear recursive process

```s
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

### iterative process
- use state variable
- if a process requires the number of steps grows linearly with n, it called a linear iterative process

```s
(define (factorial n)
  (define (fact-iter product counter max-count)
    (if (> counter max-count)
      product
      (fact-iter (* product counter)
                 (+ counter 1) 
                 max-count)))
  (fact-iter 1 1 n))
```

### comparison

- resume
  - iterative: possible with passing all variables
  - recursive: impossible, there are some "hidden" information

- recursive process / recursive procedure
  - ... procedure
    - procedure definition
    - iterative process is a recursive procedure
  - ... process
    - how the process evolves

- iterative process use "looping contructs"

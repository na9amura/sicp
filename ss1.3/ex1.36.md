### w/o average damping
```s
(fixed-point (lambda (x) (/ (log 1000) (log x))) 1.1)
```
- note log(1) = 0

### average damping
x -> log(1000) / log(x)
x + x -> (log(1000) / log(x)) + x
2x -> ...
x -> 1/2 * ((log(1000) / log(x)) + x)

```s
(fixed-point (lambda (x) (/ (+ x (/ (log 1000) (log x))) 2)) 1.1)
```
